# ase-service-stop(1) -- Stop the Background Service

## SYNOPSIS

`ase service stop`
\[`-h`|`--help`\]

## DESCRIPTION

**ase service stop** stops the per-project background service of
*ASE* (see `ase-service`(1)) via an HTTP `POST /stop` request to the
port persisted in `.ase/service.yaml`, and removes the persisted port
(and the file, if it becomes empty). This also stops a service running
in the foreground via `ase service start --foreground`. On stop, the
service persists the journal of its AI usage windows, so no usage is
lost.

If no port is persisted, or nothing listens on the persisted port, an
informational message is logged, a stale port is removed, and the
command exits with status `0`. If the persisted port is answered by a
foreign service (e.g., the service of another project), it is left
alone and the command exits with status `1`.

## OPTIONS

- \[`-h`|`--help`\]:
  Show usage information and exit.

## FILES

- `.ase/service.yaml`:
  The persisted port of the service, cleared on stop.

## EXIT STATUS

`0` if the service was stopped or was not running, `1` if the port is
in use by a foreign service or the stop request failed.

## EXAMPLES

```sh
$ ase service stop
```
