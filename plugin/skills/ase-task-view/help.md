##  NAME

`ase-task-view` - View a Task Plan

##  SYNOPSIS

`ase-task-view`
    [`--help`|`-h`]
    [`--full`|`-f`]
    [*id*]

##  DESCRIPTION

The `ase-task-view` skill renders the *task plan* identified by *id*.
The plan is loaded via the `ase_task_load` MCP tool and shown framed
between a `( TASK )` header and footer rule. If *id* is omitted, the
*current* task id (inherited from the session context) is used.

By default, the payload of every attachment in the backmatter (like an
implementation draft of `ase-task-implement --draft` or the processing
log of an `ase agent`) is elided to an `[elided: <n> lines]` marker to
keep the view compact. The `--full`|`-f` option loads the payloads, too,
and renders the plan in full, without any truncation or summarization.

An implementation draft attachment whose `Modified:` key is absent or
older than the `Modified:` key of the plan frontmatter is *stale*, as
the plan changed after the draft was created. Such a draft is reported
with a warning after the rendering, together with a hint that
`ase-task-implement --draft` has to be run again, as
`ase-task-integrate --draft` refuses a stale draft.

The frontmatter keys `Source:`, `Changeset:`, and `Target:` are
rendered as well, stating where the change set of the plan is
created from, stored in, and delivered to.

##  OPTIONS

-   `--full`|`-f`:
    Render the plan in full, including the payloads of its attachments.
    By default, each payload is elided to an `[elided: <n> lines]` marker.

##  ARGUMENTS

-   *id*:
    The unique identifier of the task plan to view. If omitted,
    the current task id is used.

##  SCENARIOS

-   You want the current or a given task plan shown
-   You want a plan rendered before deciding the next steps
-   You want a plan inspected including its implementation draft

##  EXAMPLES

View the current task plan:

```text
❯ /ase-task-view
```

View a specific task plan:

```text
❯ /ase-task-view hello
```

View a plan in full, including its implementation draft attachment:

```text
❯ /ase-task-view --full hello
```
