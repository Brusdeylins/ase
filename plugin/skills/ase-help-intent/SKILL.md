<objective>
*Match* the following free-text intent against the accumulated help of
all ASE skills and *generate* every adequately fitting `/ase:ase-xxx-xxx`
command that realizes it, ranked best-fitting first:
<intent><getopt-arguments/></intent>
</objective>

The following <corpus/> is the *accumulated help* of all ASE skills --
the concatenation of every skill's `help.md` file -- and is the *sole*
catalog you match <intent/> against:

<corpus>
@${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/data.md
</corpus>

<flow>

1.  <step id="STEP 1: Check Intent">

    <if condition="<intent/> is empty">
    Only output the following <template/> and then immediately *STOP*
    processing the entire current skill:

    <template>
    ⧉ **ASE**: ✪ skill: **ase-help-intent**, ▶ ERROR: expected a `<intent>` argument
    </template>
    </if>

    </step>

2.  <step id="STEP 2: Match Intent and Dialog">

    *REPEAT* the following sub-steps in a *LOOP* until the user either
    *executes* one of the generated commands or *cancels* the dialog in
    sub-step 4:

    1.  *Match Intent*:

        Match the current <intent/> against the <corpus/> and select
        *every* skill that adequately fits it -- judging the fit
        primarily by each skill's `##  SCENARIOS` ("You want ...") and
        `##  DESCRIPTION` sections. Order the selected skills from
        best-fitting to worst-fitting and keep at most the *8* best
        ones, so the dispatch dialog of sub-step 4 stays addressable.
        Set <count/> to the number of kept skills. Then, for each kept
        skill <n/> (numbered `1` to <count/> in rank order), from that
        skill's `##  SYNOPSIS`, `##  OPTIONS`, and `##  ARGUMENTS`
        sections in <corpus/>, *generate* a concrete command that
        realizes <intent/>:

        -   Set <name<n/>/> to the skill's name (e.g. `ase-code-lint`).
        -   Set <arguments<n/>/> to the concrete option flags and
            positional arguments -- derived from the skill's
            `##  OPTIONS` and `##  ARGUMENTS` -- that best realize
            <intent/> (may be empty).
        -   Set <command<n/>>/ase:<name<n/>/> <arguments<n/>/></command<n/>>
            (the full command line, with surplus inner spaces collapsed).
        -   Set <rationale<n/>/> to a *very brief*, single-sentence
            justification of why this skill and its options match
            <intent/>.

        Finally set <matched>yes</matched>.

    2.  *Guard No Match*:

        <if condition="no skill in <corpus/> adequately matches <intent/>">
        Set <matched>no</matched> and discard the inadequate selection of
        sub-step 1 by setting <count>0</count> and clearing all
        <name<n/>/>, <arguments<n/>/>, and <command<n/>/> placeholders
        (all set to empty), so that no stale command
        can survive into the dialog of sub-step 4. Then output the
        following <template/> and *continue* the *loop* at sub-step 4 to
        prompt the user for a refined or clearer intent via the dialog's
        free-text channel (do *not* stop and do *not* render a command):

        <template>
        <ase-tpl-bullet-secondary/> **WARNING**: no confident match for the intent -- please refine or clarify it.
        </template>
        </if>

    3.  *Render Commands*:

        Output the generated commands, in rank order, with the following
        <template/>, where the `[...]` marks the repetition of the
        command/rationale line pair for each kept skill <n/> from `1`
        to <count/>:

        <template>
        <ase-tpl-head title="SKILL COMMAND PROPOSALS"/>

        **C<n/>** ❯ `<command<n/>/>`
           ▷ *<rationale<n/>/>*

        [...]

        <ase-tpl-foot title="SKILL COMMAND PROPOSALS"/>
        </template>

    4.  *Dispatch Command*:

        In the following, you *MUST* *NOT* use your built-in
        <user-dialog-tool/> tool! Instead, you *MUST* just show a custom
        dialog according to the expanded `custom-dialog` definition. You
        *MUST* closely follow this definition.

        Let the user decide how to proceed by raising a question with the
        following custom dialog (invoked with `--other`, so that any
        free-text instruction is accepted as an intent refinement). Which
        dialog is raised depends on <matched/>, so that the `C<n/>`
        command options are offered *only* when commands were actually
        generated in sub-step 1 *and* rendered in sub-step 3:

        <if condition="<matched/> is `no`">
        <expand name="custom-dialog" arg1="--other">
            Dispatch: What would you like to do with the unmatched intent?
            REFINE: Refine or clarify the intent.
            CANCEL: Cancel this dialog.
        </expand>
        </if>
        <else>
        <expand name="custom-dialog" arg1="--other">
            Dispatch: Which of the proposed commands would you like to execute?
            C1: Execute: `<command1/>`
            [...]
            CANCEL: Cancel this dialog.
        </expand>

        The `[...]` line stands for one further answer line
        `C<n/>: Execute `<command<n/>/>` now.` per additionally kept
        skill <n/> from `2` to <count/>, in rank order, so the dialog
        offers exactly <count/> command options plus `CANCEL`.
        </else>

        Check the tool <result/> and dispatch accordingly:

        -   If <result/> is `CANCEL`:
            *Break* out of the *loop* and stop processing without any
            further output.

        -   If <result/> is `REFINE`, or <result/> matches `C<n/>` while
            <matched/> is `no`: do *not* execute anything -- output the
            following <template/> and *continue* the *loop* at sub-step 4
            to obtain a refined intent via the dialog's free-text channel:

            <template>
            <ase-tpl-bullet-secondary/> **HINT**: please enter a refined or clearer intent as free text.
            </template>

        -   If <result/> matches `C<n/>` (which implies <matched/> is
            `yes`): *Break* out of the *loop*, output the following
            <template/>, and then call the tool `Skill(skill:
            "ase:<name<n/>/>", args: "<arguments<n/>/>")` to *execute*
            the selected command:

            <template>
            ⧉ **ASE**: ◉ intent: **<intent/>**, ⌘ command: **<command<n/>/>**, ▶ status: **command executing**
            </template>

        -   If <result/> matches `OTHER: <text/>`:
            Set <intent><intent/> <text/></intent> (fold the free-text
            instruction into the intent). Then you *MUST* *continue* the
            *loop* at sub-step **2.1** to re-match the refined intent.

    </step>

</flow>
