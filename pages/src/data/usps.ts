/*  the Unique-Selling-Point (USP) entries opening the "Highlights" page

    Each entry pairs one core USP of ASE with the commands showcasing it and
    with one or more screenshots of the result. The screenshots live as
    `public/assets/usp-*.png` and are laid out by `Widget-USP-Row.astro` in a grid of
    `cols` columns, so `cols: 2` with four screenshots yields a 2x2 matrix
    (filled row by row), while a `wide` screenshot spans a whole row
    on its own. A screenshot not yet present is rendered as a
    placeholder naming the expected file, so the section can go in before
    all of its screenshots are taken.

    Where the showcased skill has an icon elsewhere on the page -- in the
    methodology strip, the workflows, or the sneak previews -- the very same
    icon is reused, so one skill reads as one symbol throughout.  */
